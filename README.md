# Langton-s-ant-in-html-js
The Langton's ant without a canvas

This is another version of Langton's ant;

That ant is a simple cellular automata with a strange behavior before 10,000 iterations.
In fact it begins to do a 'highway' as if it wants to escape the program. 

This version was made without a Canvas, but with a grid in html/css created in Javascript with an array.

To discover it, tap the space bar and wait 10,000 iterations to see the magic happen.

Enjoy !
